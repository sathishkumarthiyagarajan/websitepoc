In 2023, Stake quietly launched the best, and only, way for renters to pay rent, earn 1% Cash Back on rent payments, get 100% of convenience fees reimbursed, avoid any debt.

Why? Because it’s time to reset the relationship between renters and owners where everyone gets something back. We call that Return on Rent™.

It’s called StakePay, and it’s revolutionizing payments, resident rewards, and property performance. In fact, after StakePay there was a 73% surge in new property sign ups. Here is why:

With StakePay, properties in the Stake Network don’t have to change a thing to offer free rewards and financial amenities: no new payment portal to setup and no fees to deal with.
But the best part of StakePay compared to every other payment solution on the market? StakePay attracts renters who pay on time and stay.
Stakers who use StakePay are 68% less likely to be delinquent compared to residents in the same communities that don’t use StakePay.

Why do owners and operators love StakePay?
Most payment solutions ignore the one most important thing in this age of economic uncertainty: incentivizing renters to pay. Worse, many credit card driven payment solutions increase fraud, delinquency, and late payments. With Stake, things are different - Stakers actually outperform other renters on payments, renewals, application completion rate, and more. And Stake Network Properties see lower days on market, too. We have the metrics to show it:
